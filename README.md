## About Farm Roots

Farm Roots is an online farmers market app - designed to allow farms (or rather, the farmers) to upload their current produce options to be able to sell directly to consumers.

Farm Roots has two types of users - the farms (re: farmers) and the consumers (re: anyone who wants to buy some fresh produce!). When logging in, a user is to specify whether or not they're logging in as a farmer, which will dictate their home feed.

If a consumer does not currently have an account with Farm Roots, they can sign up as a new user to be able to start using the app.

If a farm is not currently a part of the Farm Roots database, farmers can fill out a new farm form in order to get their farm's data added to the app & start adding in the farm's produce information.

Feel free to check out the front-end repo <a href="https://github.com/bwennuh/farm-roots-frontend">here</a>!

## Database

The Farm Roots database currently includes all of the current users (which includes both consumers and farms) and all of the current produce associated with each farm.

Consumers have a name, address, and phone number.

Farms have a name, address, bio, and an associated farmer (name).

Each produce item has a name, price, and is associated to a specific farm.
